# foodvis

This repository contains interactive tools to learn about different aspects related to food and what we put inside our body like restaurants, recipes, plants and animals, processes and groceries.

The priority is on making easily accessible tools (web tools) that enable easy knowledge sharing. For instance, if one observes something interesting, it should be possible to export it as a image/video.
